# There are five trees in Jack's front yard. He checks each tree to find out how tall it is in inches and writes the height on a sheet of paper. Jack's list: 98, 94, 41, 96, and 11. What is the average height of a tree in Jack's front yard?
# Storing Values
tree1 = 98
tree2 = 94 
tree3 = 41
tree4 = 95
tree5 = 11

# Finding the sum of the total trees
sum = tree1+tree2+tree3+tree4+tree5
print("The sum of all the 5 trees is: ", sum)

# Finding the average of trees
average = sum/5
print("the average of all the trees are:", average)
